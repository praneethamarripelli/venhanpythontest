Basic Concepts 
1.	Write a function `is_prime(n: int) -> bool` that checks if a given number is prime. 
2.	Write a Python function `reverse_string(s: str) -> str` that takes a string and returns its reverse. 
3.	Given a list of integers, write a function `sum_of_squares(lst: List[int]) -> int` that returns the sum of the squares of the elements. 
4.	Write a Python program to count the frequency of each character in a given string and return a dictionary with characters as keys and their frequencies as values.
